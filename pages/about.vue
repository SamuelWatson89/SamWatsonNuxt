          Hello, i'm Sam. I've been a developer since 2019, working with digital
          marketing agencies and video games publishers. I took change in career
          from retail optics in 2019, and decided i want to spent more time on
          the internet. </p>
          
          <p>
          When studying I.T at college (way back when), i took a great liking to the website development side of things, and pursued a little in my spare time. But never having the confidence to push myself towards a career in it. A full time role at Specsavers came up, where i was working weekends, and i took it!

          I have spent a lot of time working in the world of <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/" target="_blank" class="text-link">WordPress</a> during my employment. I initially studied with Python, using <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank" class="text-link" >Django</a> as a backend solution, but i am always looking to work in new stacks.
